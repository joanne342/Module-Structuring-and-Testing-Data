// You will need to play computer with this example - use the Python Visualiser https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit
// to help you answer these questions

// Questions

// a) When formatTimeDisplay is called how many times will pad be called?
// =============> 3

// Call formatTimeDisplay with an input of 61, now answer the following:

// b) What is the value assigned to num when pad is called for the first time?
// =============> 0

// c) What is the return value of pad is called for the first time?
// =============> "00"

// d) What is the value assigned to num when pad is called for the last time in this program?  Explain your answer
// =============> 1 - Remaining seconds is calculated first with %60 and 1 is what's left over.

// e) What is the return value of pad when it is called for the last time in this program?  Explain your answer
// =============> "01" - now it's padded to 2 digits
